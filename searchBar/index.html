We want you to build an input box which allows users to create a search easily and quickly.

Requirements:

- Create a well designed input box where user can type their search.
- Display suggestions user can pick from a displayed drop down. Suggestions should be fetched and displayed while typing and also when the user focuses on the input box. The suggestions should hide on click out.
- This fiddle contains a mock server API to generate suggestions.
- getSuggestions API returns a promise which can get resolved or rejected at any time ranging from 0 - 200 ms.
- All space delimited words other than the last can be considered to be already tokenized and should not be sent to the get suggestions server API.
- Selecting suggestion should update the input text with the suggestion, and automatically add a space at the end to allow quick typing.
